# P.CASH Terminal-Wallet

We dream of a world… A world where private property is untouchable and market access is unconditional.

That obsession led us to engineer a crypto wallet that is equally open to all, lives online forever and unconditionally protects your assets. Only the user is in control of the money.

P.CASH is a powerful non-custodial multi-wallet for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, Solana, Zcash, The Open Network several and other blockchains. It provides non-custodial crypto storage, on-chain decentralized swaps, institutional grade analytics for cryptocurrency markets, extensive privacy controls and human oriented design.
