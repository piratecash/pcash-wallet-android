We are the developers of p.cash wallet, a fully open-source multi-chain crypto wallet with native support for Dash. The app is available on Google Play and F-Droid with hundreds of active users worldwide.
We have recently completed integration of cross-chain DASH swaps via our partner ChangeNow, and added support for Tangem hardware wallets.
To further improve the Dash user experience, we propose the following:
Implement support for Trezor hardware wallets
Improve blockchain interaction logic for Dash (sync, balances, transactions)
Refine UI/UX specifically for Dash users
Promote Dash usage within our wallet ecosystem
We are requesting 100 DASH in funding to support development, testing, hardware acquisition, and community outreach.
We believe this effort will directly benefit the Dash ecosystem by expanding wallet diversity, hardware support, and accessibility â€” especially for Android and privacy-focused users.
Thank you for considering our proposal.
