Please consider Reproducibile Builds. 

Hi, I'm Danny, and I work with WalletScrutiny.com.

We've recently updated the entry for your Android app (appID: cash.p.terminal) from "not source-available" to "source-available" (Just one step below Open Source)"

- We noticed that this is a fork of Unstoppable Wallet, which is currently reproducible in walletscrutiny.com
- We verify apps that are source-available for their reproducibility. (See reproducible-builds.org)
- In order to do that, we build an app based on the source code, and run a diff against the Google Play release.

Some suggestions:

- Kindly open the Issues tab in your GitHub repository - (So I won't have to make a pull request.)
- Kindly include Android build instructions - as it would help us build your app faster.

Feel free to reach out to me. Thanks.
